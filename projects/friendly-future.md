## What we ~~do~~ did
Our agency was a full service design and development shop. We handled branding, user experience design, product design, front end development, and backend development.

## The Team
It was a real pleasure working on a team of experts. Everyone at Friendly Future was a true master of their craft. On each project, I spearheaded the discovery process and user experience design. At an organizational level, I spent a lot of time on new business: generating leads, meeting with potential clients, and writing proposals.

## Client Project: The Everygirl
The Everygirl is a successful online publication. They approached us after they had built a large audience and were ready to upgrade their brand and publishing platform.

We created a stronger logo for them and refined their existing brand into a scalable, digital design system.

I started the site redesign with classic wireframes to explore the major enhancements that the client wanted to make and to work through an information architecture overhaul.

After the big ideas were explored, we built the site in Agile sprints. I collaborated closely with the visual designer and developers on the project to push out functioning software at the end of each week instead of wireframing the entire site and handing it off.

The existing site had an unpolished mobile experience. We crafted beautiful phone and tablet designs to improve the experience for the majority of their user base that was accessing the site on their mobile devices.

One of the primary goals of the project was to increase revenue.  Two of the major improvements we added were a job board and a complete online store for the company to sell their own products.

## Client Project: Sing Me a Story
Sing Me a Story is a non-profit organization whose mission is to "bring the voices of children in need to the world." The organization connects children in need with songwriters. The children's illustrated stories are turned into professionally recorded songs. Songs are used to generate donations that are shared between Sing Me a Story and the organization that is helping the child.
