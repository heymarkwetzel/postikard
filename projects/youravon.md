description: I was a UX Lead for a redesign of the tools that Representatives use to run their business.

## Project Summary

Avon is a social-selling beauty company - one of the first of its kind. They face more competition in this space than ever before.
We worked with them to fully update and redesign the suite of tools used by their business owners.

## Working together

I led several tracks of work while collaborating closely with the full design team and our client partners. I helped to plan sprints, define requirements, iterate on designs and prototypes, consult with developers and QA before releases, and more.


## RepFest 2018

We had a great relationship with our Avon partners. They treated us like family and invited us to RepFest 2018 in Columbus, OH.

We spoke to hundreds of Representatives, demoed our product updates live on iPads in personal, one-on-one conversations, and were there to hear thousands cheer in the convention cneter when the CEO showed them screen shots of our work on the big screen.
