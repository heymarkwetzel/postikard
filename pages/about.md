## What is Postikard?
Postikard is a unique way to make someone feel special with a personal message and a custom digital postcard. We believe personal connections are important, so we prioritized sending to one person at a time - just like real mail!
Send digital postcards to anyone from anywhere!

## How does it work?
All you need to do is take a picture, customize the front of your Postikard, write a short note, and send it off digitally to whoever is on your mind. We made this simple for a reason. While sharing your memories is special, we love being present to enjoy the moments as they happen.
# Snap a photo from where you are (or choose from your camera roll)!
# Add in your location and customize your text!
# Write a message to one of your favorite people!
# Share your customized Postikard via iMessage, email, or social media!
# Make someone smile!

## Why does it exist?
We believe that all adventures contain stories worth sharing; whether youâ€™re visiting a restaurant near your home or traveling to an island thousands of miles away. And we believe in connecting with others in a personal, customized way. Sure, you can post on social media but nothing beats getting a beautiful photo and a note from someone made just for you!

We created this because we love postcards, getting and sending them! But there can be a lot of logistics involved in mailing a physical postcard, so we wanted to make it a little bit easier to do, while maintaining the central idea behind a postcard: personal connection.
We have big ideas for Postikard in the future, but for now, we just wanted to help you connect in a fun way!

## Who we are?
We are two friends, Mark & Jasna, joined by our love of travel, connection and postcards!
